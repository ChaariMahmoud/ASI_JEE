## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of academic technical projects (TPs) focused on demonstrating various Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) concepts such as Servlets, Wrappers, Filters, and User Management, as well as examples using Spring Framework for Dependency Injection and Spring Data JPA.

## Features

- **JEE Servlets:** Basic to advanced examples of servlets handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **Wrappers and Filters:** Implementations of request and response wrappers and filters for request filtering.
- **User Management and Login:** Simple user management system including login functionality.
- **Dependency Injection with Spring:** Examples demonstrating the use of Spring Framework for dependency injection.
- **Spring Data JPA:** Basic examples of using Spring Data JPA for data persistence.

## Technologies Used

- Java EE
- Servlets
- JSP (JavaServer Pages)
- Spring Framework
- Spring Data JPA
- Maven

## Setup

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- Apache Maven
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
3. Build the project using Maven:
    ```sh
    mvn clean install
    ```

### Running the Application

1. Deploy the application to your preferred servlet container (e.g., Apache Tomcat).
2. Access the application via `http://localhost:8080/your-app-context`.

## Usage

### JEE Examples

- **Servlets:** Navigate to `/servlets` to view servlet examples.
- **Wrappers and Filters:** Navigate to `/filters` to see request and response filtering in action.
- **User Management:** Use the `/user-management` path for user registration and login functionalities.

### Spring Examples

- **Dependency Injection:** Explore `/spring-di` to see Spring's dependency injection.
- **Spring Data JPA:** Access `/spring-data-jpa` for data persistence examples.
